 What about Language made it easy? Javascript itself made a very easy hashmap with {}. It can be easily define just using the {} notation. In Java, hashmap is 
 HashMap<String, String> capitalCities = new HashMap<String, String>(); The syntax is not simple and straightforward compare to javascript
 
 What about the langauge made diffcult? Nothing really, there is many built-in methods with it as well, compare to many other languages.

What about Language made it easy? One thing I found javascript is easier to solve the problem is using the template literals for the output. It simply allow developers to combine javascript and string code in one line.  EX: console.log(`Day${i} Temperature: ${convertFtoC(Math.floor(Math.random() * 100))}`);

What about the langauge made diffcult? Nothing really as well, compare to any other languages, there are built-in random/floor/ceiling functions compare to Java/Python as well. Maybe not C+++, but the majority of the language can done the same.

What about Language made it easy? The Fetch() built-in function that's in the Javascript had made it absolutely simple to fetch data from the API. Compare to any other languages like python, we need to install additional package/framework to achieve the same thing.

What about the language made diffcult? In javascript, we need to connect the JS file and HTML file to use the FETCH() function, because it's only built-in the browser, not in plain Javascript file. Also, makign it appear onto the screen requires the DOM as well.
