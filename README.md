 What about Language made it easy?: Javascript itself made a very easy hashmap with {}. It can be easily define just using the {} notation. In Java, hashmap is 
 HashMap<String, String> capitalCities = new HashMap<String, String>(); The syntax is not simple and straightforward compare to javascript
 
 What about the langauge made diffcult? Nothing really, there is many built-in methods with it as well, compare to many other languages.
